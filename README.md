**Log Analysis**

Computer Activity of the public who is on a company's service and of the employees of the company are recorded on logs. A log records IP Address, User, Date, and Content of the Activity. 
All logs are sent to a database, where they are all stored. These logs could be analyzed through policies to find any suspicious activity to prevent exploitation by the public and major mistakes by employees that could damage the company. If a policy is broken, then admins are notified of the policy that is broken and the logs associated with it. 

**Current Log Policies:**

1. 2 or more users cannot be on the same IP Address within 5 seconds.

2. The same user cannot have activity on different IP addresses within 5 seconds.
